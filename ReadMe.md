Do you have:
- A bunch of RVs, potentially from a bunch of different instruments?

Do you want to:
- Compute a no-frills RV model?
- Calculate a robust mass upper limit?
- Use the transit duration to help constrain eccentricity (and therefore K) without relying on a fully combined photometry+RV model?
- Use nested sampling to marginalise over nuisance parameters?
- Compute the Bayesian evidence for the planet model compared to a no-planet model?

Then *RVUltra* is for you. It uses Ultranest but hides the silly syntax in an easy-to-use pythonic UI for use in scripts and notebooks.
